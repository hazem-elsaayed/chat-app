App is responsible for crating new sub-application each will have a number of chats and each chat can have a number of messages<br/>
This is a Ruby on Rails application. MySQL is used as a DB and Elasticsearch for searching messages 

## Description

The application allows user creating new applications where
each application will have a token (generated by the system) and a name(provided by the user). <br/>
The token is the identifier that devices use to send chats to that application.
Each application can have many chats. a chat have a number. <br/>
Numbering of chats in each application starts from 1 and no two chats in the same application will have the same number. <br/>
The number of the chat is returned in the chat creation request. A chat
contains messages and messages have numbers that start from 1 for each chat. The number of the message is also returned in the message creation request.<br/>
The client identifies the application by its token and the chat by
its number along with the application token. <br/>
There is an endpoint for searching through messages of a specific chat <br/>
